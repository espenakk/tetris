# Tetris

This is a project that uses `threepp` as a dependency.

**The game is in early stages of development**

### ~Current status of the game:

- We have a functioning grid.
- We have stored every variation of the game blocks in a sorted list.
- We have a way of handling input.

### ~TODO

- Implement input.
- Saving blocks
- Checking for collision
- Create a game loop and implement game logic.
- Make the program more object oriented.
- Finishing touches.

 *README will be expanded later* :wink:
